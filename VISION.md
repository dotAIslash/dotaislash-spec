# VERSA Vision Statement

**Vendor-neutral Extensible Repo Spec for Agents**

---

## Our Vision

**VERSA will become THE universal standard for AI agent configuration.**

Just as `.gitignore` became the universal file for Git exclusions, and `package.json` became the standard for Node.js projects, **`.ai/` folders with VERSA will become the standard way every repository communicates with AI coding agents.**

---

## The World We're Building

### üåç Universal Adoption

**Every repository, everywhere:**
- New projects scaffold with `.ai/` by default
- AI tools auto-discover and respect VERSA configurations
- Developers write their rules once, use them everywhere
- Teams collaborate with shared, version-controlled agent context

### ü§ù Tool Neutrality

**No vendor lock-in:**
- Switch from Cursor to Windsurf? Your `.ai/` folder just works
- Add GitHub Copilot to your workflow? Zero additional configuration
- Try Claude Code? Same rules, different runtime
- Future AI tools? They'll support VERSA natively

### üîí Security by Design

**Safe by default:**
- Explicit permissions for every tool action
- Secrets never committed, always bound at runtime
- Knowledge redaction prevents data leaks
- Deny ‚Üí Ask ‚Üí Allow keeps humans in control

### üìö Rich Ecosystem

**Community-driven growth:**
- Thousands of curated templates for every stack
- Pre-built agents for common tasks (review, test, document)
- Tool adapters maintained by the community
- Examples from real-world production systems

---

## Core Principles

### 1. **Portable Above All**

A `.ai/` folder created today will work with tools that don't exist yet. VERSA's stability guarantee means your investment in configuration pays dividends forever.

**Not just multi-tool. Multi-generation.**

### 2. **Boring Technology**

Plain JSON. Plain Markdown. No DSLs. No magic. No lock-in.

These formats have survived decades and will survive decades more. Your `.ai/` folder will outlive any specific AI tool.

**Simplicity scales. Complexity breaks.**

### 3. **Security Without Compromise**

Trust is hard to build and easy to lose. VERSA's permission system, secret bindings, and redaction policies ensure AI agents are powerful assistants, not security holes.

**Power with responsibility.**

### 4. **Developer Experience First**

Configuration should feel like writing code, not filling forms. Git-friendly. IDE-friendly. Human-readable. Machine-parseable.

**If it's not a joy to use, it won't be used.**

### 5. **Open and Extensible**

VERSA is a specification, not a product. Anyone can implement it. Anyone can extend it. The community owns the standard, not a company.

**Standards succeed when no one can kill them.**

## How We Get There

### Build in Public

- Share progress transparently
- Celebrate community contributions
- Document learnings and failures
- Stay connected to real developer needs

### Ship Continuously

- Release early, release often
- Prioritize working code over perfect plans
- Iterate based on feedback
- Maintain backwards compatibility obsessively

### Grow the Community

- Make it easy to contribute
- Recognize and celebrate contributors
- Create clear pathways from user ‚Üí contributor ‚Üí maintainer
- Build tools that empower, not gatekeep

### Partner Thoughtfully

- Work with AI tool vendors to add native support
- Collaborate with framework maintainers for scaffolding
- Engage with standards bodies and research communities
- Build bridges, not walls

### Stay Focused

- Don't chase every feature request
- Keep the core specification simple and stable
- Let extensions handle edge cases
- Resist bloat and complexity

## Why This Matters

### For Individual Developers

**Today:** You spend hours configuring each new AI tool, maintaining multiple rule files, and context-switching between incompatible systems.

**With VERSA:** You write your rules once. Every AI tool you use gets the same high-quality context. Switching tools is trivial. Your knowledge compounds.

### For Teams

**Today:** Team members use different AI tools with different configurations. Code style drifts. Security policies are inconsistent. Onboarding is chaos.

**With VERSA:** One `.ai/` folder, version-controlled. Every team member, every tool, same context. Code consistency improves. Security policies enforce. New hires ramp up instantly.

### For Tool Vendors

**Today:** Every vendor reinvents configuration. Fragmentation means vendor lock-in. Users resist trying new tools because migration is painful.

**With VERSA:** Vendors implement one standard reader. Users try new tools easily because their config just works. The best tool wins, not the tool with most lock-in.

### For the Ecosystem

**Today:** Fragmentation slows innovation. Best practices don't transfer. Knowledge doesn't compound. The community is divided by tool choice.

**With VERSA:** Shared standards accelerate innovation. Templates and knowledge transfer across tools. The community unites around shared formats. Everyone wins.

## The North Star

**When a developer creates a new repository in 2030, they type:**

```bash
git init
versa init
```

**And that's it.**

Their repository now has intelligent, portable, secure AI assistance that works with any tool they choose. They never think about it again unless they want to customize.

**That's the future VERSA is building.**

## Join Us

VERSA is bigger than one person, one company, or one tool. It's a community effort to bring sanity to AI agent configuration.

**We need:**
- Developers to build tools
- Writers to create documentation
- Designers to improve UX
- Users to provide feedback
- Evangelists to spread the word

**Together, we make VERSA the standard.**
