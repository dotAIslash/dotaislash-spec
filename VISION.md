# VERSA Vision Statement

**Version 1.0 | October 2025**

---

## üéØ Our Mission

**To establish VERSA as THE universal standard for AI agent configuration**, enabling developers to write their project context, rules, and preferences once, and have them work seamlessly across every AI coding tool‚Äîtoday and tomorrow.

---

## üåç The World We're Building

### Today's Reality

The AI coding tool landscape is fragmented:
- **15+ tools**, each with unique configuration formats
- **8+ file formats**: `.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.aider.conf.yml`, and more
- **Zero interoperability** between tools
- Teams using 3+ tools maintain 3+ config files
- Switching tools means complete config rewrites
- New developers face a maze of tool-specific conventions

**This is unsustainable.**

### Our Vision for Tomorrow

A world where:
- ‚úÖ **One `.ai/` folder** contains all your agent configuration
- ‚úÖ **Every AI tool** that supports VERSA reads the same context
- ‚úÖ **Switching tools** is frictionless‚Äîjust point to your `.ai/` folder
- ‚úÖ **Team onboarding** is instant‚Äîyour `.ai/` folder is in the repo
- ‚úÖ **Security is built-in**‚Äîpermissions, secrets, and redaction from day one
- ‚úÖ **Configuration is portable**‚Äîyour rules work everywhere, forever

---

## üèóÔ∏è What We're Building

### The Standard

**VERSA (Vendor-neutral Extensible Repo Spec for Agents)** is a comprehensive, open specification that defines:

1. **8 Canonical Primitives**
   - **Rules** - Project context and guidelines
   - **Prompts** - Reusable templates with variables
   - **Agents** - Declarative AI assistant presets
   - **Memory** - Session and project state
   - **Knowledge** - Document ingestion and RAG
   - **Tools** - MCP servers and custom capabilities
   - **Settings** - Model routing and preferences
   - **Permissions** - Security policies and access control

2. **Profile System**
   - Tool-specific overrides without duplication
   - Deep, shallow, and replace merge strategies
   - Graceful fallbacks for unsupported features

3. **Security Model**
   - Deny ‚Üí Ask ‚Üí Allow permission flow
   - Secret bindings (never commit secrets)
   - Knowledge redaction for sensitive data
   - Explicit file and network access controls

4. **Validation Framework**
   - JSON Schema for all primitives
   - Linting and best practices
   - Conformance testing for runtimes
   - Clear error messages

### The Ecosystem

We're building a complete ecosystem around VERSA:

- **üìñ Specification** - The canonical VERSA 1.0 standard (CC BY 4.0)
- **üîß CLI Tool** - Commands for init, lint, context, import, templates
- **üìê JSON Schemas** - Validation for all VERSA primitives
- **üîå Adapters** - Bidirectional conversion to/from tool formats
- **üìö Examples** - Curated "Awesome VERSA" templates and real-world configs
- **‚úÖ Conformance** - Test suite for VERSA-compatible runtimes
- **üåê Website** - Documentation, guides, and interactive tools
- **ü§ù Community** - Discussions, templates, and shared knowledge

---

## üéì Our Principles

### 1. **Portable by Design**
> "Write once, run everywhere."

VERSA configurations work with every VERSA-compatible tool. No vendor lock-in. No rewrites. Just portable, future-proof configuration.

### 2. **Security by Default**
> "Trust is earned, permissions are explicit."

Every operation requires explicit permission. Secrets are bound, never embedded. Knowledge redaction protects sensitive data. Security is not an afterthought‚Äîit's foundational.

### 3. **Simple but Scalable**
> "Start simple, scale naturally."

Beginners can start with a minimal `context.json`. As needs grow, add primitives incrementally. The folder structure scales from solo developers to enterprise teams.

### 4. **Human and Machine Friendly**
> "Readable by humans, parsable by machines."

Markdown for rules that humans write and maintain. JSON for structured data that machines process. YAML where appropriate. Right format for each use case.

### 5. **Convention over Configuration**
> "Sensible defaults, override when needed."

Minimal required fields. Intelligent defaults. The common case should be effortless. Advanced users can override everything.

### 6. **Open and Extensible**
> "Built for the tools of today and tomorrow."

Open specification under Creative Commons. Anyone can implement VERSA support. New primitives can be added. New tools can adopt it. The spec evolves with the ecosystem.

## ü§ù How We'll Get There

### Community-First Approach

We believe VERSA's success depends on the community:

- **Open Specification** - CC BY 4.0, freely implementable
- **Transparent Development** - All decisions in public discussions
- **Inclusive Contribution** - Welcome developers of all skill levels
- **Recognition and Credit** - Contributors featured prominently
- **Responsive Maintenance** - Quick reviews, helpful feedback

### Collaboration with Tools

We're reaching out to AI tool developers:

- **Partnership opportunities** - Help implement VERSA natively
- **Adapter collaboration** - Work together on high-quality adapters
- **Feedback loops** - Iterate spec based on real-world implementation needs
- **Joint documentation** - Co-author migration guides
- **Shared evangelism** - Promote portable configuration together

### Quality over Quantity

We won't rush to support every tool poorly:

- **Deep, not wide** - Start with excellent support for core tools
- **Quality adapters** - Bidirectional, well-tested, maintained
- **Comprehensive docs** - Clear, helpful, with examples
- **Tested at scale** - Used in real projects before declaring stable
- **Community-proven** - Validated by actual developers
